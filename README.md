# Solar-radiation-prediction
My project is base on solar rediation,here we predict  the level of the rediation of solar.
In real world lot of uses of solar rediation ,so we need to find the level of solar rediation prediction
Here we first analyse the data then we apply Random Forest Machine learning algorithm.
Here we first apply Decision Tree algorithm and after apply Random Forest .The reason of why we use Decision Tree is that beause Random Forest is Work on Decision Tree,Means it mearge Decision Tree then predict the outcomes,how tyo single Decision Tree work ,that resone we use Decision Tree
using Random Forest Algorithm we get nice accuracy
